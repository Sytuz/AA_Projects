one case sort, fifty right shelton wrong. pope’s dictum, anyone examines jervas’s version carefully, side side original, see sound spanish scholar, incomparably better one shelton, except perhaps mere colloquial spanish. was, fact, honest, faithful, painstaking translator, left version which, whatever shortcomings may be, singularly free errors mistranslations. charge stiff, dry—“wooden” word,—and one deny foundation it. may pleaded jervas good deal rigidity due abhorrence light, flippant, jocose style predecessors. one few, few, translators shown apprehension unsmiling gravity essence quixotic humour; seemed crime bring cervantes forward smirking grinning good things, may attributed great measure ascetic abstinence everything savouring liveliness characteristic translation. modern editions, observed, style smoothed smartened, without reference original spanish, made read agreeably also robbed chief merit fidelity. smollett’s version, published 1755, may almost counted one these. rate plain construction jervas’s translation freely drawn upon, little probably heed given original spanish. later translations may dismissed words. george kelly’s, appeared 1769, “printed translator,” impudent imposture, nothing motteux’s version words, there, artfully transposed;

reason pleases one please other, translator makes aim treat “don quixote” respect due great classic, acceptable even careless reader one treats famous old jest-book. question caviare general, or, is, fault rests makes so. method cervantes ear spanish people ought, mutatis mutandis, equally effective great majority english readers. rate, even readers matter indifference, fidelity method much part translator’s duty fidelity matter. please parties, much better; first duty look faithful representation author power give them, faithful letter long fidelity practicable, faithful spirit far make it. purpose dogmatise rules translation, indicate followed, least tried best ability follow, present instance. one which, seems me, cannot rigidly followed translating “don quixote,” avoid everything savours affectation. book is, indeed, one sense protest it, man abhorred cervantes. reason, think, temptation use antiquated obsolete language resisted. affectation, one warrant excuse. spanish probably undergone less change since seventeenth century language europe, far greater certainly best part “don quixote” differs little language colloquial spanish present day. except tales quixote’s speeches, translator uses simplest plainest everyday language almost always one approaches nearest original. seeing story “don quixote” characters incidents two centuries half familiar household words english mouths, seems old familiar names phrases changed without good reason. course translator holds “don quixote” receive treatment great classic deserves, feel bound injunction laid upon morisco chap. ix omit add anything. cervantes four generations laughed “don quixote” occurred anyone ask, manner man miguel de cervantes saavedra whose name title-page;

“hold thy peace patience; day come thou shalt see thine eyes honourable thing wander pursuit calling; nay, tell me, greater pleasure world, delight equal winning battle, triumphing one’s enemy? none, beyond doubt.” “very likely,” answered sancho, “though know it; know since knights-errant, since worship one (for right reckon one honourable number) never battle except one biscayan, even worship came half ear half helmet less; till cudgellings cudgellings, cuffs cuffs, getting blanketing above, falling enchanted persons cannot avenge know delight, worship calls it, conquering enemy like.” “that vexes me, ought vex thee, sancho,” replied quixote; “but henceforward endeavour hand sword made craft kind enchantments take effect upon carries it, even possible fortune may procure belonged amadis called ‘the knight burning sword,’ one best swords ever knight world possessed, for, besides said virtue, cut like razor, armour, however strong enchanted might be, could resist it.” “such luck,” said sancho, “that even happened worship found sword, would, like balsam, turn serviceable good dubbed knights only, squires, might sup sorrow.” “fear that, sancho,” said quixote: “heaven deal better thee.” thus talking, quixote squire going along, when, road following, quixote perceived approaching large thick cloud dust, seeing turned sancho said: “this day, sancho, seen boon fortune reserving me;

nevertheless, seeing imagination see exist, began thus loud voice: “that knight thou seest yonder yellow armour, bears upon shield lion crowned crouching feet damsel, valiant laurcalco, lord silver bridge;

true, time two flocks come close. “the fear thou art in, sancho,” said quixote, “prevents thee seeing hearing correctly, one effects fear derange senses make things appear different are; thou art fear, withdraw one side leave myself, alone suffice bring victory side shall give aid;” saying gave rocinante spur, putting lance rest, shot slope like thunderbolt. sancho shouted him, crying, “come back, señor quixote;

said he: “did tell come back, señor quixote; going attack armies droves sheep?” “that’s thief sage, enemy, alter falsify things,” answered quixote; “thou must know, sancho, easy matter sort make us believe choose;

taken loathing stomach turned, vomited inside master, left precious state. sancho ran ass get something wherewith clean himself, relieve master, alforjas; finding them, well-nigh took leave senses, cursed anew, heart resolved quit master return home, even though forfeited wages service hopes promised island. quixote rose, putting left hand mouth keep teeth falling altogether, laid hold bridle rocinante, never stirred master’s side—so loyal well-behaved he—and betook squire stood leaning ass hand cheek, like one deep dejection. seeing mood, looking sad, quixote said him: “bear mind, sancho, one man another, unless another; tempests fall upon us signs fair weather coming shortly, things go well us, impossible good evil last ever; hence follows evil lasted long, good must nigh hand; thou must distress thyself misfortunes happen me, since thou hast share them.” “how not?” replied sancho; “was blanketed yesterday perchance father’s son? alforjas missing to-day treasures, belong myself?” “what! alforjas missing, sancho?” said quixote. “yes, missing,” answered sancho. “in case nothing eat to-day,” replied quixote. “it would so,” answered sancho, “if none herbs worship says know meadows, knights-errant unlucky worship wont supply such-like shortcomings.” “for that,” answered quixote, “i would rather quarter bread, loaf couple pilchards’ heads, herbs described dioscorides, even doctor laguna’s notes. nevertheless, sancho good, mount thy beast come along me, god, provides things, fail us (more especially active service are), since fails midges air, grubs earth, tadpoles water, merciful maketh sun rise good evil, sendeth rain unjust just.” “your worship would make better preacher knight-errant,” said sancho. “knights-errant knew ought know everything, sancho,” said quixote;

“let us find place shelter night, god grant may somewhere blankets, blanketeers, phantoms, enchanted moors; are, may devil take whole concern.” “ask god, son,” said quixote; thou lead thou wilt, time leave lodging thy choice; reach thy hand, feel thy finger, find many teeth grinders missing right side upper jaw, feel pain.” sancho put fingers, feeling asked him, “how many grinders used worship side?” “four,” replied quixote, “besides back-tooth, whole quite sound.” “mind saying, señor.” “i say four, five,” answered quixote, “for never life tooth grinder drawn, fallen destroyed decay rheum.” “well, then,” said sancho, “in lower side worship two grinders half, upper neither half all, smooth palm hand.” “luckless am!” said quixote, hearing sad news squire gave him;

likewise thou mayest rely upon affair blanket happened thee thy fault reminding time; make amends, ways compounding everything order chivalry.” “why! taken oath sort, then?” said sancho. “it makes matter thou hast taken oath,” said quixote; “suffice see thou art quite clear complicity; whether no, ill done provide remedy.” “in case,” said sancho, “mind worship forget oath; perhaps phantoms may take heads amuse me; even worship see obstinate.” engaged talk, night overtook road reached discovered place shelter;

“and fate cannot help listening thee, go on.” “and so, lord soul,” continued sancho, said, shepherd love torralva shepherdess, wild buxom lass something look man her, little moustaches; fancy see now.” “then knew her?” said quixote. “i know her,” said sancho, “but told story said true certain told another might safely declare swear seen myself. course time, devil, never sleeps puts everything confusion, contrived love shepherd bore shepherdess turned hatred ill-will, reason, according evil tongues, little jealousy caused crossed line trespassed forbidden ground;

“i went little far joke. tell me, worship, peace made us (and may god bring adventures may befall safe sound brought one), thing laugh at, good story, great fear in?—at least in; worship see neither know understand either fear dismay is.” “i deny,” said quixote, “that happened us may worth laughing at, worth making story about, everyone shrewd enough hit right point thing.” “at rate,” said sancho, “your worship knew hit right point pike, aiming head hitting shoulders, thanks god smartness dodging it. let pass;

“what helmet fulling mills?” “i don’t know,” replied sancho, “but, faith, might speak used, perhaps could give reasons worship would see mistaken say.” “how mistaken say, unbelieving traitor?” returned quixote; “tell me, seest thou yonder knight coming towards us dappled grey steed, upon head helmet gold?” “what see make out,” answered sancho, “is man grey ass like own, something shines head.” “well, helmet mambrino,” said quixote; “stand one side leave alone him; thou shalt see how, without saying word, save time, shall bring adventure issue possess helmet longed for.” “i take care stand aside,” said sancho; “but god grant, say more, may marjoram fulling mills.” “i told thee, brother, account mention fulling mills again,” said quixote, “or vow—and say more—i’ll full soul you.” sancho held peace dread lest master carry vow hurled like bowl him. fact matter regards helmet, steed, knight quixote saw, this. neighbourhood two villages, one small neither apothecary’s shop barber, close had, barber larger served smaller, sick man required bled another man wanted shaved, errand barber going, carrying brass basin;

“that wonderful piece enchanted helmet must strange accident come hands someone unable recognise realise value, who, knowing did, seeing purest gold, must melted one half sake might worth, made like barber’s basin thou sayest;

moreover, intention putting way wanting it, mean, five senses, keep wounded wounding anyone: blanketed say nothing, hard prevent mishaps sort, come nothing squeeze shoulders together, hold breath, shut eyes, let go luck blanket may send us.” “thou art bad christian, sancho,” said quixote hearing this, “for injury done thee thou never forgettest it: know part noble generous hearts attach importance trifles. lame leg hast thou got it, broken rib, cracked head, thou canst forget jest? jest sport was, properly regarded, seen light would returned done mischief revenging thee greeks rape helen, who, alive now, dulcinea lived then, might depend upon would famous beauty is;” heaved sigh sent aloft;

like know might least change trappings.” “on head quite certain,” answered quixote, “and matter doubtful, pending better information, say thou mayest change them, thou hast urgent need them.” “so urgent it,” answered sancho, “that person could want more;” forthwith, fortified licence, effected _mutatio capparum_, rigged beast ninety-nines making quite another thing it. done, broke fast remains spoils war plundered sumpter mule, drank brook flowed fulling mills, without casting look direction, loathing hold alarm caused them;

dorothea cried spare would doubt taken life spot. “do think,” said pause, “you scurvy clown, always interfering me, always offending always pardoning? don’t fancy it, impious scoundrel, beyond doubt thou art, since thou hast set thy tongue going peerless dulcinea. know not, lout, vagabond, beggar, might infuses arm strength enough kill flea? say, scoffer viper’s tongue, think kingdom cut giant’s head made marquis (for count already accomplished decided), might dulcinea, employing arm instrument achievements? fights conquers me, live breathe her, owe life her. whoreson scoundrel, ungrateful are, see raised dust earth titled lord, return make great benefit speak evil conferred upon you!” sancho stunned heard master said, rising degree nimbleness ran place behind dorothea’s palfrey, position said master: “tell me, señor;

taken lump like her.” “now forgive thee,” said quixote; “and thou forgive injury done thee; first impulses control.” “that see,” replied sancho, “and wish speak always first impulse, cannot help saying, rate, tip tongue.” “for that, sancho,” said quixote, “take heed thou sayest, pitcher goes often well—i need say thee.” “well, well,” said sancho, “god heaven, sees tricks, judge harm, speaking right, worship it.” “that enough,” said dorothea; “run, sancho, kiss lord’s hand beg pardon, henceforward circumspect praise abuse; say nothing disparagement lady toboso, know nothing save servant; put trust god, fail obtain dignity live like prince.” sancho advanced hanging head begged master’s hand, quixote dignity presented him, giving blessing soon kissed it; bade go ahead little, questions ask matters great importance discuss him. sancho obeyed, two gone distance advance quixote said him, “since thy return opportunity time ask thee many particulars touching thy mission answer thou hast brought back, chance granted us time opportunity, deny happiness thou canst give good news.” “let worship ask will,” answered sancho, “for shall find way found way in; implore you, señor, revengeful future.” “why dost thou say that, sancho?” said quixote. “i say it,” returned, “because blows quarrel devil stirred us night, said lady dulcinea, love reverence would relic—though nothing her—merely something belonging worship.” “say subject thy life, sancho,” said quixote, “for displeasing me;

“and uncommon unexampled, one attempt invent concoct fiction, doubt wit keen enough imagine it.” “but another strange thing it,” said curate, “is that, apart silly things worthy gentleman says connection craze, subjects dealt with, discuss perfectly rational manner, showing mind quite clear composed; that, provided chivalry touched upon, one would take anything man thoroughly sound understanding.” holding conversation quixote continued sancho, saying: “friend panza, let us forgive forget quarrels, tell now, dismissing anger irritation, where, how, didst thou find dulcinea? doing? didst thou say her? answer? look reading letter? copied thee? everything matter seems thee worth knowing, asking, learning; neither adding falsifying give pleasure, yet curtailing lest deprive it.” “señor,” replied sancho, “if truth told, nobody copied letter me, carried letter all.” “it thou sayest,” said quixote, “for notebook wrote found possession two days thy departure, gave great vexation, knew thou wouldst finding thyself without letter;

“but want burn any, let great captain diego garcía; would rather child mine burnt either others.” “brother,” said curate, “those two books made lies, full folly nonsense; great captain true history, contains deeds gonzalo hernandez cordova, many great achievements earned title world great captain, famous illustrious name, deserved alone;

though strove imagine desire could troubled friend, conjectures far truth, relieve anxiety perplexity causing him, told flagrant injustice great friendship seeking circuitous methods confiding hidden thoughts, well knew might reckon upon counsel diverting them, help carrying effect. “that truth,” replied anselmo, “and relying upon tell thee, friend lothario, desire harasses knowing whether wife camilla good perfect think be;

thought thou wert speaking seriously would allowed thee go far; put stop thy long harangue listening thee verily suspect either thou dost know me, know thee; no, know well thou art anselmo, thou knowest lothario; misfortune is, seems me, thou art anselmo thou wert, must thought lothario be; things thou hast said anselmo friend, thou demandest asked lothario thou knowest. true friends prove friends make use them, poet said, _usque ad aras;_ whereby meant make use friendship things contrary god’s will. this, then, heathen’s feeling friendship, much christian’s, knows divine must forfeited sake human friendship? friend go far put aside duty heaven fulfil duty friend, matters trifling little moment, affect friend’s life honour. tell me, anselmo, two art thou imperilled, hazard gratify thee, thing detestable thou seekest me? neither forsooth;

never suffered lothario see alone, always attended men women servants, especially handmaid hers, leonela name, much attached (for brought together childhood father’s house), kept marriage anselmo. first three days lothario speak her, though might done removed cloth servants retired dine hastily;

modest bearing camilla, calmness countenance, composure aspect enough bridle tongue lothario. influence many virtues camilla exerted imposing silence lothario’s tongue proved mischievous them, tongue silent thoughts busy, could dwell leisure upon perfections camilla’s goodness beauty one one, charms enough warm love marble statue, say heart flesh. lothario gazed upon might speaking her, thought worthy loved was; thus reflection began little little assail allegiance anselmo, thousand times thought withdrawing city going anselmo never see see camilla. already delight found gazing interposed held fast. put constraint upon himself, struggled repel repress pleasure found contemplating camilla; alone blamed weakness, called bad friend, nay bad christian; argued matter compared anselmo; always coming conclusion folly rashness anselmo worse faithlessness, could excuse intentions easily god man, reason fear punishment offence. short beauty goodness camilla, joined opportunity blind husband placed hands, overthrew loyalty lothario; giving heed nothing save object towards inclinations led him, anselmo three days absent, carrying continual struggle passion, began make love camilla much vehemence warmth language overwhelmed amazement, could rise place retire room without answering word. hope always springs love weakened lothario repelling demeanour; contrary passion camilla increased, discovering never expected, knew do; considering neither safe right give chance opportunity speaking again, resolved send, night, one servants letter anselmo, addressed following words him. chapter xxxiv. continued novel “the ill-advised curiosity” “it commonly said army looks ill without general castle without castellan, say young married woman looks still worse without husband unless good reasons it. find ill ease without you, incapable enduring separation, unless return quickly shall go relief parents’ house, even leave without protector;

delighted beyond measure intelligence sent word leave house account, would shortly return. camilla astonished anselmo’s reply, placed greater perplexity before, neither dared remain house, yet go parents’; remaining virtue imperilled, going opposing husband’s commands. finally decided upon worse course her, remain, resolving fly presence lothario, might give food gossip servants; began regret written husband, fearing might imagine lothario perceived lightness impelled lay aside respect owed her; confident rectitude put trust god virtuous intentions, hoped resist silence solicitations lothario, without saying anything husband involve quarrel trouble; even began consider excuse lothario anselmo ask induced write letter. resolutions, honourable judicious effectual, remained next day listening lothario, pressed suit strenuously camilla’s firmness began waver, virtue enough come rescue eyes keep showing signs certain tender compassion tears appeals lothario awakened bosom. lothario observed this, inflamed more. short felt anselmo’s absence afforded time opportunity must press siege fortress, assailed self-esteem praises beauty, nothing quickly reduces levels castle towers fair women’s vanity vanity upon tongue flattery. fact utmost assiduity undermined rock purity engines camilla brass must fallen. wept, entreated, promised, flattered, importuned, pretended much feeling apparent sincerity, overthrew virtuous resolves camilla triumph least expected longed for. camilla yielded, camilla fell;

embraced other, anselmo asked tidings life death. “the tidings give thee, anselmo friend,” said lothario, “are thou dost possess wife worthy pattern crown good wives. words addressed borne away wind, promises despised, presents refused, feigned tears shed turned open ridicule. short, camilla essence beauty, treasure-house purity dwells, gentleness modesty abide virtues confer praise, honour, happiness upon woman. take back thy money, friend;

undeceived believed imagination, lothario avoided seeing her, alone her. anselmo told might quite easy score suspicion, knew lothario love damsel rank city celebrated name chloris, even not, fidelity great friendship left room fear. camilla, however, informed beforehand lothario love chloris pretence, told anselmo order able sometimes give utterance praises camilla herself, doubt would fallen despairing toils jealousy; forewarned received startling news without uneasiness. next day three table anselmo asked lothario recite something composed mistress chloris; camilla know her, might safely say liked. “even know her,” returned lothario, “i would hide nothing, lover praises lady’s beauty, charges cruelty, casts imputation upon fair name;

“but lovers defective expression truthful.” “there doubt that,” observed anselmo, anxious support uphold lothario’s ideas camilla, regardless design deep love lothario; taking delight anything his, knowing thoughts writings object, real chloris, asked repeat sonnet verses recollected any. “i do,” replied lothario, “but think good first one, or, correctly speaking, less bad;

went adding link link chain binding making dishonour secure; lothario dishonour told honoured; thus step camilla descended towards depths abasement, mounted, opinion, towards summit virtue fair fame. happened finding one occasion alone maid, camilla said her, “i ashamed think, dear leonela, lightly valued compel lothario purchase least expenditure time full possession quickly yielded free will. fear think ill pliancy lightness, considering irresistible influence brought bear upon me.” “let trouble you, lady,” said leonela, “for take away value thing given make less precious give quickly really valuable worthy prized; nay, wont say gives quickly gives twice.” “they say also,” said camilla, “that costs little valued less.” “that saying hold good case,” replied leonela, “for love, heard say, sometimes flies sometimes walks; one runs, moves slowly; cools, others burns; wounds, others slays; begins course desires, moment completes ends it; morning lay siege fortress night taken it, power resist it; dread of, fear, must befallen lothario, love chosen absence lord instrument subduing you? absolutely necessary complete love resolved upon, without affording time let anselmo return presence compel work left unfinished;

certain ladies’ imprudences make servants shameless, who, see mistresses make false step, think nothing going astray themselves, known. camilla could entreat leonela say nothing doings called lover, conduct affairs secretly lest come knowledge anselmo lothario. leonela said would, kept word way confirmed camilla’s apprehension losing reputation means; abandoned bold leonela, soon perceived mistress’s demeanour wont be, audacity introduce lover house, confident even mistress saw would dare expose him; sins mistresses entail mischief among others; make slaves servants, obliged hide laxities depravities; case camilla, though perceived, many times, leonela lover room house, dare chide her, afforded opportunities concealing removed difficulties, lest seen husband. unable, however, prevent seen one occasion, sallied forth daybreak, lothario, who, knowing was, first took spectre; but, soon saw hasten away, muffling face cloak concealing carefully cautiously, rejected foolish idea, adopted another, would ruin camilla found remedy. occur lothario man seen issuing untimely hour anselmo’s house could entered leonela’s account, even remember person leonela; thought camilla light yielding him, another; penalty erring woman’s sin brings it, honour distrusted even whose overtures persuasions yielded; believes surrendered easily others, gives implicit credence every suspicion comes mind. lothario’s good sense seems failed juncture; prudent maxims escaped memory; without reflecting rationally, without ado, impatience blindness jealous rage gnawed heart, dying revenge upon camilla, done wrong, anselmo risen hastened said him, “know, anselmo, several days past struggling myself, striving withhold thee longer possible right conceal thee. know camilla’s fortress surrendered ready submit will;

pretend absent thyself two three days thou hast wont occasions, contrive hide thyself closet; tapestries things afford great facilities thy concealment, thou wilt see thine eyes mine camilla’s purpose may be. guilty one, may feared rather expected, silence, prudence, discretion thou canst thyself become instrument punishment wrong done thee.” anselmo amazed, overwhelmed, astounded words lothario, came upon time least expected hear them, looked upon camilla triumphed pretended attacks lothario, beginning enjoy glory victory. remained silent considerable time, looking ground fixed gaze, length said, “thou hast behaved, lothario, expected thy friendship: follow thy advice everything; thou wilt, keep secret thou seest kept circumstances unlooked for.” lothario gave word, leaving repented altogether said him, perceiving foolishly acted, might revenged upon camilla less cruel degrading way. cursed want sense, condemned hasty resolution, knew course take undo mischief find ready escape it. last decided upon revealing camilla, and, want opportunity so, found alone day; she, soon chance speaking him, said, “lothario friend, must tell thee sorrow heart fills seems ready burst; wonder not; audacity leonela reached pitch every night conceals gallant house remains till morning, expense reputation; inasmuch open anyone question may see quitting house unseasonable hours; distresses cannot punish chide her, privity intrigue bridles mouth keeps silent hers, dreading catastrophe come it.” camilla said lothario first imagined device delude idea man seen going leonela’s lover hers; saw wept suffered, begged help her, became convinced truth, conviction completed confusion remorse; however, told camilla distress herself, would take measures put stop insolence leonela. time told what, driven fierce rage jealousy, said anselmo, arranged hide closet might see plainly little preserved fidelity him; entreated pardon madness, advice repair it, escape safely intricate labyrinth imprudence involved him. camilla struck alarm hearing lothario said, much anger, great good sense, reproved rebuked base design foolish mischievous resolution made; woman nature nimbler wit man good evil, though apt fail sets deliberately reason, camilla spur moment thought way remedy appearance irremediable, told lothario contrive next day anselmo conceal place mentioned, hoped concealment obtain means enjoying future without apprehension; without revealing purpose entirely charged careful, soon anselmo concealed, come leonela call him, said answer would answered known anselmo listening. lothario pressed explain intention fully, might certainty precaution take care saw needful. “i tell you,” said camilla, “there nothing take care except answer shall ask you;” wish explain beforehand meant do, fearing lest unwilling follow idea seemed good one, try devise less practicable plan. lothario retired, next day anselmo, pretence going friend’s country house, took departure, returned conceal himself, able easily, camilla leonela took care give opportunity; placed hiding state agitation may imagined would feel expected see vitals honour laid bare eyes, found point losing supreme blessing thought possessed beloved camilla. made sure anselmo’s hiding-place, camilla leonela entered closet, instant set foot within camilla said, deep sigh, “ah! dear leonela, would better, unwilling know lest seek prevent it, take anselmo’s dagger asked pierce vile heart mine? no; reason suffer punishment another’s fault. first know bold licentious eyes lothario seen could encouraged reveal design base disclosed regardless friend honour. go window, leonela, call him, doubt street waiting carry vile project;

consider, señora, weak women man, determined, comes base purpose, blind urged passion, perhaps put execution may worse taking life. ill betide master, anselmo, giving authority house shameless fellow! supposing kill him, señora, suspect mean do, shall dead?” “what, friend?” replied camilla, “we shall leave anselmo bury him; reason light labour hide infamy ground. summon him, make haste, time delay taking vengeance wrong seems offence loyalty owe husband.” anselmo listening this, every word camilla uttered made change mind; heard resolved kill lothario first impulse come show avert disaster; anxiety see issue resolution bold virtuous restrained himself, intending come forth time prevent deed. moment camilla, throwing upon bed close by, swooned away, leonela began weep bitterly, exclaiming, “woe me! fated dying arms flower virtue upon earth, crown true wives, pattern chastity!” effect, anyone heard would taken tender-hearted faithful handmaid world, mistress another persecuted penelope. camilla long recovering fainting fit coming said, “why go, leonela, call hither friend, falsest friend sun ever shone upon night concealed? away, run, haste, speed! lest fire wrath burn delay, righteous vengeance hope melt away menaces maledictions.” “i going call him, señora,” said leonela; “but must first give dagger, lest gone means give cause love weep lives.” “go peace, dear leonela, so,” said camilla, “for rash foolish may be, mind, defending honour, going much lucretia say killed without done anything wrong, without first killed guilt misfortune lay. shall die, die; must full vengeance upon brought weep audacity fault mine gave birth to.” leonela required much pressing would go summon lothario, last went, awaiting return camilla continued, speaking herself, “good god! would prudent repulsed lothario, done many time before, allow him, doing, think unchaste vile, even short time must wait undeceive him? doubt would better;

worst bathed chaste blood foul blood falsest friend friendship ever saw world;” uttered words paced room holding unsheathed dagger, irregular disordered steps, gestures one would supposed lost senses, taken violent desperado instead delicate woman. anselmo, concealed behind tapestries hidden himself, beheld amazed all, already felt seen heard sufficient answer even greater suspicions; would well pleased proof afforded lothario’s coming dispensed with, feared sudden mishap; point showing coming forth embrace undeceive wife paused saw leonela returning, leading lothario. camilla saw him, drawing long line front floor dagger, said him, “lothario, pay attention say thee: chance thou darest cross line thou seest, even approach it, instant see thee attempt instant pierce bosom dagger hold hand; thou answerest word desire thee listen me, afterwards thou shalt reply may please thee. first, desire thee tell me, lothario, thou knowest husband anselmo, light thou regardest him; secondly desire know thou knowest too. answer this, without embarrassment reflecting deeply thou wilt answer, riddles put thee.” lothario dull first moment camilla directed make anselmo hide understood intended do, therefore fell idea readily promptly made imposture look true truth; answered thus: “i think, fair camilla, thou wert calling ask questions remote object come; defer promised reward thou art so, thou mightst put still longer, longing happiness gives distress nearer comes hope gaining it;

must freedom mine, call immodesty, proceed deliberate intention, heedlessness women guilty inadvertence think occasion reserve. tell me, traitor, word sign give reply thy prayers could awaken thee shadow hope attaining thy base wishes? thy professions love sternly scornfully rejected rebuked? thy frequent pledges still frequent gifts believed accepted? persuaded one long persevere attempt win love unsustained hope, willing attribute blame thy assurance, doubt thoughtlessness mine time fostered thy hopes;

so, death mean inflict death, take one fully satisfy longing revenge hope have; shall see, wheresoever may go, penalty awarded inflexible, unswerving justice placed position desperate.” uttered words, incredible energy swiftness flew upon lothario naked dagger, manifestly bent burying breast almost uncertain whether demonstrations real feigned, obliged recourse skill strength prevent striking him; reality act strange farce mystification that, give colour truth, determined stain blood; perceiving, pretending, could wound lothario, said, “fate, seems, grant desire complete satisfaction, able keep satisfying partially least;” making effort free hand dagger lothario held grasp, released it, directing point place could inflict deep wound, plunged left side high close shoulder, allowed fall ground faint. leonela lothario stood amazed astounded catastrophe, seeing camilla stretched ground bathed blood still uncertain true nature act. lothario, terrified breathless, ran haste pluck dagger; saw slight wound relieved fears admired subtlety, coolness, ready wit fair camilla; better support part play began utter profuse doleful lamentations body dead, invoking maledictions also means placing position: knowing friend anselmo heard spoke way make listener feel much pity camilla, even though supposed dead. leonela took arms laid bed, entreating lothario go quest someone attend wound secret, time asking advice opinion say anselmo lady’s wound chance return healed. replied might say liked, state give advice would use; could tell try stanch blood, going never seen; every appearance deep grief sorrow left house; found alone, nobody see him, crossed unceasingly, lost wonder adroitness camilla consistent acting leonela. reflected convinced anselmo would second portia wife, looked forward anxiously meeting order rejoice together falsehood truth craftily veiled could imagined. leonela, told her, stanched lady’s blood, sufficed support deception; washing wound little wine bound best skill, talking time tending strain that, even nothing else said before, would enough assure anselmo camilla model purity. leonela’s words camilla added own, calling cowardly wanting spirit, since enough time need rid life much loathed. asked attendant’s advice whether ought inform beloved husband happened, bade say nothing it, would lay upon obligation taking vengeance lothario, could great risk himself; duty true wife give husband provocation quarrel, but, contrary, remove far possible him. camilla replied believed right would follow advice, rate would well consider explain wound anselmo, could help seeing it; leonela answered know tell lie even jest. “how know, dear?” said camilla, “for dare forge keep falsehood life depended it. think escape difficulty, better tell plain truth find us untrue story.” “be uneasy, señora,” said leonela; “between to-morrow think must say him, perhaps wound hidden sight, heaven pleased aid us purpose good honourable. compose yourself, señora, endeavour calm excitement lest lord find agitated; leave rest care god’s, always supports good intentions.” anselmo deepest attention listened seen played tragedy death honour, performers acted wonderfully effective truth seemed become realities parts played. longed night opportunity escaping house go see good friend lothario, give vent joy precious pearl gained established wife’s purity. mistress maid took care give time opportunity get away, taking advantage made escape, went quest lothario, would impossible describe embraced found him, things said joy heart, praises bestowed upon camilla;

believing laying giant, given many sword cuts skins whole room full wine. seeing landlord enraged fell quixote, clenched fist began pummel way, cardenio curate dragged off, would brought war giant end. spite poor gentleman never woke barber brought great pot cold water well flung one dash body, quixote woke up, completely understand matter. dorothea, seeing short slight attire was, would go witness battle champion opponent. sancho, went searching floor head giant, finding said, “i see it’s enchantment house;

better support position, lothario begged excused coming house, displeasure camilla regarded presence plain seen. befooled anselmo said would account allow thing, thousand ways became author dishonour, believed insuring happiness. meanwhile satisfaction leonela saw empowered carry amour reached height that, regardless everything else, followed inclinations unrestrainedly, feeling confident mistress would screen her, even show manage safely. last one night anselmo heard footsteps leonela’s room, trying enter see was, found door held him, made determined open it; exerting strength forced open, entered room time see man leaping window street. ran quickly seize discover was, unable effect either purpose, leonela flung arms round crying, “be calm, señor; give way passion follow escaped this;

“but know oath good one, know barber honest fellow.” “even not,” said curate, “i go bail answer matter silent dummy, pain paying penalty may pronounced.” “and security you, señor curate?” said quixote. “my profession,” replied curate, “which keep secrets.” “ods body!” said quixote this, “what majesty command, public proclamation, knights-errant scattered spain assemble fixed day capital, even half dozen come, may one among alone suffice destroy entire might turk. give attention follow me. it, pray, new thing single knight-errant demolish army two hundred thousand men, one throat made sugar paste? nay, tell me, many histories filled marvels?

cautions warnings unavailing dissuade chaplain taking away. governor, seeing order archbishop, obeyed, dressed licentiate clothes, new decent. he, soon saw clothed like one senses, divested appearance madman, entreated chaplain permit charity go take leave comrades madmen. chaplain said would go see madmen house;

would gladly relieved doubt, arising quixote said, worries works conscience.” “the señor curate leave that,” returned quixote, “so may declare doubt, pleasant doubt one’s conscience.” “well then, permission,” said curate, “i say doubt that, do, cannot persuade whole pack knights-errant you, señor quixote, mentioned, really truly persons flesh blood, ever lived world; contrary, suspect fiction, fable, falsehood, dreams told men awakened sleep, rather still half asleep.” “that another mistake,” replied quixote, “into many fallen believe ever knights world, often, divers people divers occasions, tried expose almost universal error light truth. sometimes successful purpose, sometimes have, supporting upon shoulders truth;

showed sense falling love gentle softness medoro rather roughness roland.” “that angelica, señor curate,” returned quixote, “was giddy damsel, flighty somewhat wanton, left world full vagaries fame beauty. treated scorn thousand gentlemen, men valour wisdom, took smooth-faced sprig page, without fortune fame, except reputation gratitude affection bore friend got him. great poet sang beauty, famous ariosto, caring sing adventures contemptible surrender (which probably creditable), dropped says: received sceptre cathay, bard defter quill may sing day;

“what islands? something eat, glutton gormandiser thou art?” “it something eat,” replied sancho, “but something govern rule, better four cities four judgeships court.” “for that,” said housekeeper, “you don’t enter here, bag mischief sack knavery; go govern house dig seed-patch, give looking islands shylands.” curate barber listened great amusement words three; quixote, uneasy lest sancho blab blurt whole heap mischievous stupidities, touch upon points might altogether credit, called made two hold tongues let come in. sancho entered, curate barber took leave quixote, whose recovery despaired saw wedded crazy ideas, saturated nonsense unlucky chivalry; said curate barber, “you see, gossip, least thinking it, gentleman another flight.” “i doubt it,” returned barber; “but wonder much madness knight simplicity squire, firm belief island, suppose exposures could imagined would get head.” “god help them,” said curate; “and let us look-out see comes absurdities knight squire, seems cast mould, madness master without simplicity man would worth farthing.” “that true,” said barber, “and like much know pair talking moment.” “i promise you,” said curate, “the niece housekeeper tell us by-and-by, ones forget listen.” meanwhile quixote shut room sancho, alone said him, “it grieves greatly, sancho, thou shouldst said, sayest, took thee thy cottage, thou knowest remain house. sallied forth together, took road together, wandered abroad together; fortune luck; blanketed thee once, belaboured hundred times, advantage thee.” “that reasonable,” replied sancho, “for, worship says, misfortunes belong properly knights-errant squires.” “thou art mistaken, sancho,” said quixote, “according maxim _quando caput dolet_, etc.” “i don’t understand language own,” said sancho. “i mean say,” said quixote, “that head suffers members suffer; so, thy lord master, thy head, thou part thou art servant; therefore evil affects shall affect give thee pain, affects thee give pain me.” “it so,” said sancho; “but blanketed member, head side wall, looking flying air, feel pain whatever;

“thou mayest speak freely, sancho, without beating bush.” “well then,” said he, “first all, tell common people consider worship mighty great madman, less fool. hidalgos say that, keeping within bounds quality gentleman, assumed ‘don,’ made knight jump, four vine-stocks couple acres land, never shirt back. caballeros say want hidalgos setting opposition them, particularly squire hidalgos polish shoes darn black stockings green silk.” “that,” said quixote, “does apply me, always go well dressed never patched; ragged may be, ragged wear tear arms time.” “as worship’s valour, courtesy, accomplishments, task, variety opinions. say, ‘mad droll;’ others, ‘valiant unlucky;’ others, ‘courteous meddling,’ go number things don’t leave whole bone either worship myself.” “recollect, sancho,” said quixote, “that wherever virtue exists eminent degree persecuted. none famous men lived escaped calumniated malice. julius cæsar, boldest, wisest, bravest captains, charged ambitious, particularly cleanly dress, pure morals. alexander, whose deeds name great, say somewhat drunkard. hercules, many labours, said lewd luxurious. galaor, brother amadis gaul, whispered over-quarrelsome, brother lachrymose. that, sancho, amongst calumnies good men, mine may let pass, since thou hast said.” “that’s is, body father!” “is more, then?” asked quixote. “there’s tail skinned yet,” said sancho; “all far cakes fancy bread; worship wants know calumnies bring you, fetch one instant tell whole without missing atom; last night son bartholomew carrasco, studying salamanca, came home made bachelor, went welcome him, told worship’s history already abroad books, title ingenious gentleman quixote la mancha;

nothing choose write hidden.” “what!” said sancho, “a sage enchanter! why, bachelor samson carrasco (that name spoke of) says author history called cide hamete berengena.” “that moorish name,” said quixote. “may so,” replied sancho; “for heard say moors mostly great lovers berengenas.” “thou must mistaken surname ‘cide’—which means arabic ‘lord’—sancho,” observed quixote. “very likely,” replied sancho, “but worship wishes fetch bachelor go twinkling.” “thou wilt great pleasure, friend,” said quixote, “for thou hast told amazed me, shall eat morsel agree heard it.” “then him,” said sancho;

“for need recording events change affect truth history, tend bring hero contempt. æneas truth earnest pious virgil represents him, ulysses wise homer describes him.” “that true,” said samson; “but one thing write poet, another write historian; poet may describe sing things, were, ought been; historian write down, ought been, were, without adding anything truth taking anything it.” “well then,” said sancho, “if señor moor goes telling truth, doubt among master’s drubbings mine found; never took measure worship’s shoulders without whole body; right wonder that, for, master says, members must share pain head.” “you sly dog, sancho,” said quixote; “i’ faith, want memory choose remember.” “if try forget thwacks gave me,” said sancho, “my weals would let me, still fresh ribs.” “hush, sancho,” said quixote, “and don’t interrupt bachelor, entreat go tell said history.” “and me,” said sancho, “for say, too, one principal presonages it.” “personages, presonages, friend sancho,” said samson. “what! another word-catcher!” said sancho; “if that’s way shall make end lifetime.” “may god shorten mine, sancho,” returned bachelor, “if second person history, even would rather hear talk cleverest whole book; though some, too, say showed over-credulous believing possibility government island offered señor quixote.” “there still sunshine wall,” said quixote; “and sancho somewhat advanced life, experience years bring, fitter better qualified governor present.” “by god, master,” said sancho, “the island cannot govern years have, i’ll able govern years methuselah; difficulty said island keeps distance somewhere, know where; want head govern it.” “leave god, sancho,” said quixote, “for perhaps better think; leaf tree stirs god’s will.” “that true,” said samson; “and god’s will, want thousand islands, much less one, sancho govern.” “i seen governors parts,” said sancho, “that compared shoe-sole; called ‘your lordship’ served silver.” “those governors islands,” observed samson, “but governments easier kind: govern islands must least know grammar.” “i could manage gram well enough,” said sancho; “but mar neither leaning liking, don’t know is; leaving matter government god’s hands, send wherever may service, may tell you, señor bachelor samson carrasco, pleased beyond measure author history spoken way said gives offence; for, faith true squire, said anything unbecoming old christian, am, deaf would heard it.” “that would working miracles,” said samson. “miracles miracles,” said sancho, “let everyone mind speaks writes people, set random first thing comes head.” “one faults find history,” said bachelor, “is author inserted novel called ‘the ill-advised curiosity;’ bad ill-told, place nothing history worship señor quixote.” “i bet son dog mixed cabbages baskets,” said sancho. “then, say,” said quixote, “the author history sage, ignorant chatterer, who, haphazard heedless way, set writing it, let turn might, orbaneja, painter úbeda, used do, who, asked painting, answered, ‘what may turn out.’ sometimes would paint cock fashion, unlike, write alongside gothic letters, ‘this cock;’ history, require commentary make intelligible.” “no fear that,” returned samson, “for plain nothing puzzle over; children turn leaves, young people read it, grown men understand it, old folk praise it; word, thumbed, read, got heart people sorts, instant see lean hack, say, ‘there goes rocinante.’ given reading pages, lord’s ante-chamber ‘don quixote’ found;

notwithstanding this, write fling books broadcast world fritters.” “there book bad something good it,” said bachelor. “no doubt that,” replied quixote; “but often happens acquired attained well-deserved reputation writings, lose entirely, damage degree, give press.” “the reason that,” said samson, “is, printed works examined leisurely, faults easily seen; greater fame writer, closely scrutinised. men famous genius, great poets, illustrious historians, always, commonly, envied take particular delight pleasure criticising writings others, without produced own.” “that wonder,” said quixote; “for many divines good pulpit, excellent detecting defects excesses preach.” “all true, señor quixote,” said carrasco; “but wish fault-finders lenient less exacting, pay much attention spots bright sun work grumble at; _aliquando bonus dormitat homerus_, remember long remained awake shed light work little shade possible; perhaps may find fault may moles, sometimes heighten beauty face bears them; say great risk prints book exposes himself, impossibilities greatest write one satisfy please readers.” “that treats must pleased few,” said quixote. “quite contrary,” said bachelor;

“it is, ass turned up, author speaks sancho mounted it.” “i don’t know say that,” said sancho, “unless historian made mistake, perhaps might blunder printer’s.” “no doubt that’s it,” said samson; “but became hundred crowns? vanish?” sancho answered, “i spent good, wife’s, children’s, made wife bear patiently wanderings highways byways, service master, quixote;

“but anything importance mentioned.” “does author promise second part all?” said quixote. “he promise one,” replied samson; “but says found it, know got it; cannot say whether appear not; so, head, say second part ever good, others enough already written quixote, thought second part; though some, jovial rather saturnine, say, ‘let us quixotades, let quixote charge sancho chatter, matter may turn out, shall satisfied that.’” “and author mean do?” said quixote. “what?” replied samson;

“provided commanded imposed upon vanquished things transgress limits chivalry.” “that understood,” replied mirrors. moment extraordinary nose squire presented quixote’s view, less amazed sancho sight; insomuch set monster kind, human new species unearthly breed. sancho, seeing master retiring run course, like left alone nosy man, fearing one flap nose battle would would left stretched ground, either blow fright; ran master, holding rocinante’s stirrup-leather, seemed time turn about, said, “i implore worship, señor, turn charge, help cork tree, able witness gallant encounter worship going knight, taste better ground.” “it seems rather, sancho,” said quixote, “that thou wouldst mount scaffold order see bulls without danger.” “to tell truth,” returned sancho, “the monstrous nose squire filled fear terror, dare stay near him.” “it is,” said quixote, “such one would terrify too; so, come, help thee thou wilt.” quixote waited sancho mount cork tree mirrors took much ground considered requisite, and, supposing quixote done same, without waiting sound trumpet signal direct them, wheeled horse, agile better-looking rocinante, top speed, easy trot, proceeded charge enemy;

unparalleled fury bore mirrors stood digging spurs horse buttons, without able make stir finger’s length spot come standstill course. lucky moment crisis, quixote came upon adversary, trouble horse, embarrassed lance, either could manage, time lay rest. quixote, however, paid attention difficulties, perfect safety without risk encountered mirrors force brought ground spite haunches horse, heavy fall lay appearance dead, stirring hand foot. instant sancho saw fall slid cork tree, made haste master was, who, dismounting rocinante, went stood mirrors, unlacing helmet see dead, give air happen alive, saw—who say saw, without filling hear astonishment, wonder, awe? saw, history says, countenance, face, look, physiognomy, effigy, image bachelor samson carrasco! soon saw called loud voice, “make haste here, sancho, behold thou art see believe;

perhaps kill one enemies, enchanters.” “thy advice bad,” said quixote, “for enemies fewer better;” drawing sword carry effect sancho’s counsel suggestion, squire mirrors came up, without nose made hideous, cried loud voice, “mind about, señor quixote; friend, bachelor samson carrasco, feet, squire.” “and nose?” said sancho, seeing without hideous feature before; replied, “i pocket,” putting hand right pocket, pulled masquerade nose varnished pasteboard make already described; sancho, examining closely, exclaimed aloud voice amazement, “holy mary good me! isn’t tom cecial, neighbour gossip?” “why, sure am!” returned unnosed squire; “tom cecial am, gossip friend sancho panza; i’ll tell presently means tricks falsehoods brought here; meantime, beg entreat master touch, maltreat, wound, slay knight mirrors feet; because, beyond dispute, rash ill-advised bachelor samson carrasco, fellow townsman.” moment mirrors came himself, quixote perceiving it, held naked point sword face, said him, “you dead man, knight, unless confess peerless dulcinea del toboso excels casildea de vandalia beauty;

“why, devil first thought enchantment business? much enchanted father.” ecclesiastic, heard talking giants caitiffs enchantments, began suspect must quixote la mancha, whose story duke always reading; often reproved it, telling foolish read fooleries; becoming convinced suspicion correct, addressing duke, said angrily him, “señor, excellence give account god good man does. quixote, simpleton, whatever name is, cannot, imagine, blockhead excellence would him, holding encouragement go vagaries follies.” turning address quixote said, “and you, num-skull, put head knight-errant, vanquish giants capture miscreants? go ways good hour, good hour said you. go home bring children any, attend business, give going wandering world, gaping making laughing-stock know don’t. where, heaven’s name, discovered ever knights-errant? giants spain miscreants la mancha, enchanted dulcineas, rest silly things tell you?” quixote listened attentively reverend gentleman’s words, soon perceived done speaking, regardless presence duke duchess, sprang feet angry looks agitated countenance, said—but reply deserves chapter itself. p31e.jpg (46k) chapter xxxii. reply quixote gave censurer, incidents, grave droll p32a.jpg (152k) full size quixote, then, risen feet, trembling head foot like man dosed mercury, said hurried, agitated voice, “the place in, presence stand, respect always profession worship belongs, hold bind hands indignation;

“say defence, master mine, there’s nothing world said, thought, insisted on; besides, gentleman denies, has, ever knights-errant world, wonder knows nothing talking about?” “perhaps, brother,” said ecclesiastic, “you sancho panza mentioned, master promised island?” “yes, am,” said sancho, “and what’s more, one deserves much anyone;

duke said much him, could not, laughter uncalled-for anger provoked. done laughing, said quixote, “you replied behalf stoutly, sir knight lions, occasion seek satisfaction this, which, though may look like offence, all, for, women give offence, ecclesiastics, well know.” “that true,” said quixote, “and reason is, liable offence cannot give offence anyone. women, children, ecclesiastics, cannot defend themselves, though may receive offence cannot insulted, offence insult is, excellence well knows, difference: insult comes one capable offering it, so, maintains it; offence may come quarter without carrying insult. take example: man standing unsuspectingly street ten others come armed beat him; draws sword quits like man, number antagonists makes impossible effect purpose avenge himself; man suffers offence insult. another example make thing plain: man standing back turned, another comes strikes him, striking takes flight, without waiting instant, pursues overtake him; received blow received offence, insult, insult must maintained. struck him, though sneakingly treacherously, drawn sword stood faced him, struck would received offence insult time; offence struck treacherously, insult struck maintained done, standing ground without taking flight. so, according laws accursed duel, may received offence, insult, neither women children maintain it, wound, way standing ground, connected religion;

“and let sancho go take sleep, talk by-and-by greater length, settle may soon go stick government, says.” sancho kissed duchess’s hand, entreated let good care taken dapple, light eyes. “what dapple?” said duchess. “my ass,” said sancho, “which, mention name, i’m accustomed call dapple;

and, bent ever upon plan practising jokes upon look appearance adventures, took basis action quixote already told cave montesinos, order play famous one. duchess marvelled sancho’s simplicity could great make believe absolute truth dulcinea enchanted, enchanter trickster business. having, therefore, instructed servants everything do, six days afterwards took hunt, great retinue huntsmen beaters crowned king. presented quixote hunting suit, sancho another finest green cloth; quixote declined put on, saying must soon return hard pursuit arms, could carry wardrobes stores him. sancho, however, took gave him, meaning sell first opportunity. appointed day arrived, quixote armed himself, sancho arrayed himself, mounted dapple (for would give though offered horse), placed midst troop huntsmen. duchess came splendidly attired, quixote, pure courtesy politeness, held rein palfrey, though duke wanted allow him; last reached wood lay two high mountains, where, occupying various posts, ambushes, paths, distributing party different positions, hunt began great noise, shouting, hallooing, that, baying hounds blowing horns, could hear one another. duchess dismounted, sharp boar-spear hand posted knew wild boars habit passing. duke quixote likewise dismounted placed one side her. sancho took position rear without dismounting dapple, dared desert lest mischief befall him. scarcely taken stand line several servants, saw huge boar, closely pressed hounds followed huntsmen, making towards them, grinding teeth tusks, scattering foam mouth. soon saw quixote, bracing shield arm, drawing sword, advanced meet him; duke boar-spear same; duchess would gone front duke prevented her. sancho alone, deserting dapple sight mighty beast, took heels hard could strove vain mount tall oak. clinging branch, however, half-way struggle reach top, bough, ill-luck hard fate, gave way, caught fall broken limb oak, hung suspended air unable reach ground. finding position, green coat beginning tear, reflecting fierce animal came way might able get him, began utter cries, call help earnestly, heard see felt sure must teeth wild beast. end tusked boar fell pierced blades many spears held front him;

attachment loyalty one other. quixote went unhooked sancho, who, soon found ground, looked rent huntingcoat grieved heart, thought got patrimonial estate suit. meanwhile slung mighty boar across back mule, covered sprigs rosemary branches myrtle, bore away spoils victory large field-tents pitched middle wood, found tables laid dinner served, grand sumptuous style easy see rank magnificence provided it. sancho, showed rents torn suit duchess, observed, “if hunting hares, small birds, coat would safe plight it’s in; don’t know pleasure one find lying wait animal may take life tusk gets you. recollect heard old ballad sung says, bears thou devoured, erst famous favila.” “that,” said quixote, “was gothic king, who, going a-hunting, devoured bear.” “just so,” said sancho; “and would kings princes expose dangers sake pleasure which, mind, ought one, consists killing animal done harm whatever.” “quite contrary, sancho; wrong there,” said duke; “for hunting suitable requisite kings princes anybody else. chase emblem war; stratagems, wiles, crafty devices overcoming enemy safety; extreme cold intolerable heat borne, indolence sleep despised, bodily powers invigorated, limbs engages made supple, and, word, pursuit may followed without injury anyone enjoyment many; best is, everybody, field-sports sorts are, except hawking, also kings great lords. reconsider opinion therefore, sancho, governor take hunting, find good it.” “nay,” said sancho, “the good governor broken leg keep home;” would nice thing if, people trouble coming look business, governor away forest enjoying himself; government would go badly fashion. faith, señor, hunting amusements fit idlers governors; intend amuse playing fours eastertime, bowls sundays holidays; huntings don’t suit condition agree conscience.” “god grant may turn so,” said duke; “because it’s long step saying doing.” “be may,” said sancho, “‘pledges don’t distress good payer,’ ‘he god helps better gets early,’ ‘it’s tripes carry feet feet tripes;’ mean say god gives help duty honestly, doubt i’ll govern better gerfalcon. nay, let put finger mouth, they’ll see whether bite not.” “the curse god saints upon thee, thou accursed sancho!” exclaimed quixote; “when day come—as often said thee—when shall hear thee make one single coherent, rational remark without proverbs? pray, highnesses, leave fool alone, grind souls between, say two, two thousand proverbs, dragged much season, much purpose as—may god grant much health him, want listen them!” “sancho panza’s proverbs,” said duchess, “though number greek commander’s, therefore less esteemed conciseness maxims. part, say give pleasure others may better brought seasonably introduced.” pleasant conversation sort passed tent wood, day spent visiting posts hiding-places, night closed in, not, however, brilliantly tranquilly might expected season, midsummer; bringing kind haze greatly aided project duke duchess; thus, night began fall, little twilight set in, suddenly whole wood four sides seemed fire, shortly after, here, there, sides, vast number trumpets military instruments heard, several troops cavalry passing wood. blaze fire noise warlike instruments almost blinded eyes deafened ears stood by, indeed wood. heard repeated lelilies fashion moors rush battle;

“for wasn’t wouldn’t swear god conscience; feel sure must good souls even hell itself.” without dismounting, demon turned quixote said, “the unfortunate valiant knight montesinos sends thee, knight lions (would saw thee claws), bidding tell thee wait wherever may find thee, brings call dulcinea del toboso, may show thee needful order disenchant her;

quixote could feel sure whether happened cave montesinos true not; deep cogitations duke said him, “do mean wait, señor quixote?” “why not?” replied he; “here wait, fearless firm, though hell come attack me.” “well then, see another devil hear another horn like last, i’ll wait much flanders,” said sancho. night closed completely, many lights began flit wood, fiery exhalations earth, look like shooting-stars eyes, flit heavens; frightful noise, too, heard, like made solid wheels ox-carts usually have, harsh, ceaseless creaking which, say, bears wolves put flight, happen passing. addition commotion, came disturbance increase tumult, seemed truth, four sides wood, four encounters battles going time;

malambruno though enchanter christian, works enchantments great circumspection, taking good care fall anyone.” “well then,” said sancho, “god holy trinity gaeta give help!” “since memorable adventure fulling mills,” said quixote, “i never seen sancho fright now; superstitious others abject fear would cause little trepidation spirit. come here, sancho, leave gentles would say word two thee private;” drawing sancho aside among trees garden seizing hands said, “thou seest, brother sancho, long journey us, god knows shall return, leisure opportunities business allow us; wish thee therefore retire thy chamber, though thou wert going fetch something required road, trice give thyself five hundred lashes account three thousand three hundred thou art bound; good, make beginning thing half finished.” “by god,” said sancho, “but worship must senses! like common saying, ‘you see child, want virgin.’ i’m go sitting bare board, worship would score backside! indeed, worship reasonable. let us shave duennas; return promise word make haste wipe that’s due satisfy worship; can’t say more.” “well, comfort promise, good sancho,” replied quixote, “and believe thou wilt keep it; indeed though stupid thou art veracious.” “i’m voracious,” said sancho, “only peckish; even little, still i’d keep word.” went back mount clavileño, quixote said, “cover thine eyes, sancho, mount; one sends us lands far distant cannot mean deceive us sake paltry glory derived deceiving persons trust him; though turn contrary hope, malice able dim glory undertaken exploit.” “let us off, señor,” said sancho, “for taken beards tears ladies deeply heart, shan’t eat bit relish seen restored former smoothness. mount, worship, blindfold yourself, go croup, plain rider saddle must mount first.” “that true,” said quixote, and, taking handkerchief pocket, begged distressed one bandage eyes carefully; bandaged uncovered again, saying, “if memory deceive me, read virgil palladium troy, wooden horse greeks offered goddess pallas, big armed knights, afterwards destruction troy; would well see, first all, clavileño stomach.” “there occasion,” said distressed one; “i bail him, know malambruno nothing tricky treacherous him; may mount without fear, señor quixote; head harm befalls you.” quixote thought say anything regard safety would putting courage unfavourable light; so, without words, mounted clavileño, tried peg, turned easily; stirrups legs hung down, looked like nothing much figure roman triumph painted embroidered flemish tapestry. much grain, slowly, sancho proceeded mount, and, settling well could croup, found rather hard, soft, asked duke would possible oblige pad kind, cushion; even couch lady duchess, bed one pages; haunches horse like marble wood. trifaldi observed clavileño would bear kind harness trappings, best plan would sit sideways like woman, way would feel hardness much. sancho so, and, bidding farewell, allowed eyes bandaged, immediately afterwards uncovered again, looking tenderly tearfully garden, bade help present strait plenty paternosters ave marias, god might provide someone say many them, whenever found similar emergency. quixote exclaimed, “art thou gallows, thief, thy last moment, use pitiful entreaties sort? cowardly, spiritless creature, art thou place fair magalona occupied, descended, grave, become queen france; unless histories lie? beside thee, may put par valiant pierres, pressed spot press? cover thine eyes, cover thine eyes, abject animal, let thy fear escape thy lips, least presence.” “blindfold me,” said sancho; “as won’t let commend commended god, wonder afraid region devils carry us peralvillo?” blindfolded, quixote, finding settled satisfaction, felt peg, instant placed fingers it, duennas stood lifted voices exclaiming, “god guide thee, valiant knight! god thee, intrepid squire! now, ye go cleaving air swiftly arrow! ye begin amaze astonish gazing earth! take care wobble about, valiant sancho! mind thou fall not, thy fall worse rash youth’s tried steer chariot father sun!” sancho heard voices, clinging tightly master winding arms round him, said, “señor, make going high, voices reach us seem speaking quite close us?” “don’t mind that, sancho,” said quixote; “for affairs sort, flights like common course things, see hear much like thousand leagues off; don’t squeeze tight thou wilt upset me; really know thou hast uneasy frightened at, safely swear never mounted smoother-going steed days life; one would fancy never stirred one place. banish fear, friend, indeed everything going ought, wind astern.” “that’s true,” said sancho, “for strong wind comes side, seems people blowing thousand pair bellows;” case; puffing great pair bellows; whole adventure well planned duke, duchess, majordomo, nothing omitted make perfectly successful. quixote now, feeling blast, said, “beyond doubt, sancho, must already reached second region air, hail snow generated;

astonishment increased one side garden perceived tall lance planted ground, hanging two cords green silk smooth white parchment following inscription large gold letters: “the illustrious knight quixote la mancha has, merely attempting it, finished concluded adventure countess trifaldi, otherwise called distressed duenna;

told that, instant clavileño descended flaming air came ground, whole band duennas trifaldi vanished, already shaved without stump left. duchess asked sancho fared long journey, sancho replied, “i felt, señora, flying region fire, master told me, wanted uncover eyes bit;

“i know ladyship well bear mind flying enchantment might seen whole earth men enchantment whatever way looked; won’t believe this, believe that, uncovering nearly eyebrows, saw close sky palm half it;

“in earthly region colours; mean goats colours.” “that’s plain,” said sancho; “of course must difference goats heaven goats earth.” “tell me, sancho,” said duke, “did see he-goat among goats?” “no, señor,” said sancho;
